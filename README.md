# Museum-of-candy

## About this project

During my learning journey, I had the opportunity to learn new skills through tutorials. On of the videos was teaching us how to use the Bootstrap library through a little project called "Museum of Candy". 

Instead of using it I decided to go go back to the basis and code only using CSS with no help. And here is the result!
